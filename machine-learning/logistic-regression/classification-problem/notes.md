## Classification Problem

Let's talk about the classification problem. Classification is one of the important classes of problems in supervised machine learning. In classification problems, the target variable $y$, we want to predict takes on only a small number of discrete values. Based on how many values $y$ can take classification problems are divided into two :

1. Binary classification problems
2. Multi-class classification problems

Let us look into each of these classifications.
