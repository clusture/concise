# Summary and Observations: Linear Regression

We started with house price prediction. There the goal is to predict the house price given both living area and number of bedrooms. We used linear model as hypotheses function which became linear regression. It modeled the house price as a linear function of features like living area and number of bedrooms. In order to learn to predict it better, we defined least squares cost function on training set. We formulates the ordinary least squares cost optimization problem. To learn, the optimal parameter of hypotheses function of linear regression, we showed two methods. One is iterative procedure called  gradient descent algorithm. another is called normal equations, which gives the closed form expression for solving the ordinary least squares optimization problem.
