# Normal Equations for Linear Regression

One way of minimizing least squares cost $J$ is through gradient descent algorithm. Her, we discuss second way of minimizing least squares cost function, this method is called normal equations. We introduce normal equations and discuss matrix notations. We formulate the ordinary least squares problem in matrix form and derive the normal equations. Finally, we present closed form expression for ordinary least squares regression.
