# Linear Regression

We formally describe the regression problem under supervised learning settings. We introduce one of the models that address regression problems called the linear regression model. Linear regression due to its relative simplicity and well-known properties is one of the popular techniques in machine learning. We describe ordinary least squares linear regression method and its techniques. We provide two ways of learning the optimal parameters of ordinary least squares regression. One with gradient decent and another with normal equations.
