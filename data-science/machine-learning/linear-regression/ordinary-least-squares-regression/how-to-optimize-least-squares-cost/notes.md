# Least Squares Regression Optimization Problem

We want to come up with a algorithm that gives the $\theta$ that minimizes $J(\theta)$, i.e, least squares cost function. It turns out, there are two approaches to find $\theta$ that minimizes the least squares cost function.

The two approaches are as follows :
1. Gradient Descent Algorithms
2. Normal Equations

Let's keep going and look at each of these techniques.
