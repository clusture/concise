# Nearest Neighbors

Nearest neighbor algorithms are one of the simplest supervised learning algorithms. Though, they can be used for both classification and regression problems, they are mostly used for classification problems.

Nearest neighbor algorithms belong to  non-parameterized class of algorithms. That means that they do not make any assumptions about underlying data.

We introduce nearest-neighbor algorithms first. We extend the ideas of nearest neighbor algorithms for k-nearest neighbors classifier. And, we discuss the problems with nearest-neighbor algorithms.
