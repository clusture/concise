# k-Means Clustering

In unsupervised learning, we are given a training set with $\{x^1, x^2, \ldots, x^n\}$. Here, we are not given a labels for the training examples.

Clustering is a unsupervised learning technique which groups unlabeled data based on their similarities or differences.

K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning. In this topic, we will learn what is K-means clustering algorithm, how the algorithm works.

In this chapter, we introduce the clustering problem. We discuss k-means algorithm and its intuition. We provide the summary and observations along with the summary.
