# Summary and Observations of Nearest Neighbors

Nearest neighbor algorithms are simple supervised learning algorithms. Though they can be used for both classification and regression problems, they are widely used for classification problems. Nearest neighbor algorithms are easy to understand and work with.

We started from simplest of all nearest neighbors called 1-nearest neighbor classifier. We extended the idea of 1-nearest neighbor classifier to k-nearest neighbors. We used k-nearest neighbors for classification problems. We saw the problems associated with nearest neighbor algorithms.
