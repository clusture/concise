# Laplace Smoothing

The Naive Bayes algorithm as we have described it will work fairly well for many problems, however it may fail to work well for certain cases especially in text classification tasks.

We briefly discuss a problem with the algorithm in its current form, and then talk about how we can fix it. We use Laplace smoothing technique which is a simple change for Naive Bayes algorithm that makes it work much better.
