# Summary and Observations of Generative Learning Algorithms

Generative learning algorithms are important class of supervised learning algorithms. We saw how generation learning algorithm works and how they are different from the discriminative learning algorithms.

Naive Bayes algorithm is one of the popular generative learning used for classification problems. We understood how it works for example application called email spam detection. 

We also saw the problem corresponding to Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification problems. We saw how it overcome this issue with the simple technique called Laplace Smoothing.

Naive Bayes algorithm works well for some of the problems. This is a fast algorithm compared to other iterative algorithms like Logistic Regression. It is a go to algorithm If you want a quick solution for a classification problem.
