# Summary and Observations of Learning Theory Topics

We discussed few of the important topics in designing machine learning solutions. The following are the topics :
1. Bias-Variance tradeoff
2. Overfitting and Underfitting
3. Regularization
4. Model Selection
5. Cross-validation
6. Feature Selection

These are the topics that govern the choices end-to-end machine learning pipeline starting from the model building to model selection and model performance improvements.
