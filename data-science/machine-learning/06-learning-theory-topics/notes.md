# Learning Theory Topics

Let us look at some of the important topics in learning theory. This helps in building intuition and  building important rules for working with machine learning algorithms.

We will be looking at the following topics: First, we see the concept of Bias-Variance tradeoff. This will lead us to underfitting/overfitting, regularization and model selection topics.

Second, we will look into the topic of generalization and cross-validation. Third, we will look into some of the feature selection mechanisms to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Finally, we will provide summary and observations for the topic of learning theory.
