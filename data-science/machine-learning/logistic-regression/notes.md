We introduce logistic regression, which is one of the popular techniques to solve the particular type of classification problems. We provide the details about how logistic regression works and its algorithm. We give the maximum likelihood estimation technique for learning the optimal parameters of logistic regression model. Finally, we provide the summary and observations of logistic regression.
