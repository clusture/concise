# Maximum Likelihood Estimation: Logistic Regression

Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a technique we use to find the optimal parameter $\theta$ of logistic regression model. In general, MLE is a method of estimating the parameters of an assumed probability distribution, given some observed data. This is achieved by first defining the likelihood function and then maximizing a likelihood function so that, under the assumed model, the observed data is most probable. The point in the parameter space that maximizes the likelihood function is called the maximum likelihood estimate. 

This technique is relevant in the logistic regression as the output of the logistic regression's hypothesis function lies between $0$ and $1$ and can be thought as a probability distribution. We discuss more details about the derivation of maximum likelihood estimate of logistic regression model.
