# Binary and Multiclass Classification

Let's talk about the binary classification problem. This is one of the classification problem where the target variable $y$ can take on only two values, 0 and 1. For instance, if we are trying to build a spam classifier for email, then $x^i$ may be some features of a piece of email, and $y$ may be 1 if it is a piece of spam mail, and 0 otherwise. 0 is also called the negative class, and 1 the positive class, and they are sometimes also denoted by the symbols "-" and "+". Given $x^i$ corresponding to the $y^i$ is also called the label of the training example.

Whereas in multiclass classification, the target variable $y$ can take more than two values. For instance, trying to build a system to classify a set of images of fruits which may be oranges, apples, or pears.

The goal of learning algorithm is predict or assign one of the class to the given input variables. Let us look for classification algorithms and discuss.
